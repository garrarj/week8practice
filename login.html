    ****Practice Task - Form***** 
    Once you have copied over the content from 'index.html', create a form inside the 'main' tag. This form should include the following:
        1. A heading that states what the user is doing (e.g. signing up for a service, etc.)
        2. A short text block that gives a reason why the user should sign up (i.e. A compelling reason to join. Maybe this is a sign up form for a video streaming service, or a social media platform. Give a reason why the user should care)
        3. Four form fields and four related labels
            3a. An input and label for the user's full name - This input should be a optional field
            3b. An input and label for the user's email address - This input should be a required field
            3c. An input and label for the user's phone number - This input should be an optional field
            3d. An input and label for the user's password - This input should be a required field
        4. Each label needs a 'for' attribute
        5. Each entry needs the following attributes:
            - 'type'
            - 'name'
            - 'ID'
            - 'placeholder'
            - 'required' or 'optional'
            
        6. A submit input with 'type' and 'value' attributes
